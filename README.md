Portfolio Website - Morgane Tacconi
  **Description**
This project is a personal website designed to showcase my background, skills, and experiences as a full-stack developer in training. My goal is to create a modern and professional portfolio while applying the skills I've gained through my studies.

  **Project Objectives**

**Practice front-end skills:** Applying HTML and CSS (including Flexbox and Grid) to structure and style the content.
**Develop a responsive interface:** Optimizing the site for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
**Personal presentation:** Providing an overview of my background, projects, and technical and professional skills.

  **Site Structure**
The site is divided into several sections:

**Home Page:** A brief introduction with a personal slogan.
**About Me:** A summary of my background and philosophy as a developer.
**Professional Experience:** Descriptions of past jobs and projects, illustrating my progress in the field.
**Technical Skills:** A list of technologies and tools that I am currently learning or have expertise in.

  **Technologies Used**
HTML5: Semantic structure of the content.
CSS3: Design and layout using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsiveness.
Git & GitHub: Version control and deployment of the source code.

 ** Key Features**
**Responsive design:** The site is designed to automatically adapt to screens of different sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
**Modern and minimalist interface:** Using a combination of simple typography and colors, the site design reflects a professional and modern style.
**Accessibility optimization:** Special attention was given to color contrasts, semantic HTML structure, and readable fonts to ensure good accessibility.


  **Future Improvements**
Add more projects: Enrich the projects section as I complete new work.
Integrate new technologies: Explore adding JavaScript and potentially frameworks like React.
Continuous responsive design improvement: Further adjust the site to optimize display across different screen sizes and orientations.
